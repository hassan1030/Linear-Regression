# Linear Regression: Automobile Fuel Efficiency Analysis

This project analyzes automobile fuel efficiency (MPG - Miles Per Gallon) using linear regression. The goal is to help a car manufacturer identify key factors contributing to higher gas mileage and optimize vehicle design for better fuel efficiency.

## Project Overview

The project involves:
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing values and converting data types for consistency.
   - Ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis by treating categorical variables appropriately.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing key insights into features affecting MPG.
   - Identifying trends and correlations among variables.
3. **Linear Regression Modeling**:
   - Building a predictive model to estimate MPG based on vehicle attributes.
4. **Model Optimization**:
   - Selecting the most impactful features to improve model performance and reduce complexity.

## Key Results

- **Significant features influencing MPG**:
  - **Weight**: Heavier vehicles negatively impact fuel efficiency.
  - **Displacement**: Larger engine sizes reduce MPG.
  - **Horsepower**: High-performance engines trade off fuel economy.
  - **Acceleration**: Modern, efficient designs show a weak positive impact on MPG.
- The optimized model achieved:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 7.88
  - **R-squared Score**: 0.85
